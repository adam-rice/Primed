## Reflection

This was a solo project for my third module at the Turing School. My project goals included familiarizing myself with Angular, a framework I had not worked with, getting data from two APIs simultaneously, and writing the CSS using Sass.

The biggest challenge came from learning how to structure the application with Angular 1. While at Turing we learned and used React often and even had a small EmberJS project, but we did not cover Angular. I enjoyed learning about the correct use of Controllers, Directives, and Routes in Angular. My next challenge with this application will be utilizing webpack or even nodeJS so that I can get the app to run on gh-pages where currently http secure is preventing me from getting the API data that I need.
